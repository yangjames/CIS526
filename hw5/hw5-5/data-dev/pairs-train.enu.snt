Corresponding to most kinds of particles , there is an associated antiparticle with the same mass and opposite electric charge .
If a particle and antiparticle are in the appropriate quantum states , then they can annihilate each other and produce other particles .
Experiment
In 1932 , soon after the prediction of positrons by Paul Dirac , Carl D. Anderson found that cosmic-ray collisions produced these particles in a cloud chamber — a particle detector in which moving electrons -LRB- or positrons -RRB- leave behind trails as they move through the gas .
The electric charge-to-mass ratio of a particle can be measured by observing the curling of its cloud-chamber track in a magnetic field .
The antiproton and antineutron were found by Emilio Segrè and Owen Chamberlain in 1955 at the University of California , Berkeley .
Since then the antiparticles of many other subatomic particles have been created in particle accelerator experiments .
In recent years , complete atoms of antimatter have been assembled out of antiprotons and positrons , collected in electromagnetic traps .
... the development of quantum field theory made the interpretation of antiparticles as holes unnecessary , even though it lingers on in many textbooks .
— Steven Weinberg in The quantum theory of fields , Vol I , p 14 , ISBN 0-521-55001-7
Solutions of the Dirac equation contained negative energy quantum states .
Even worse , it could keep radiating infinite amount of energy because there were infinitely many negative energy states available .
To prevent this unphysical situation from happening , Dirac proposed that a `` sea '' of negative-energy electrons fills the universe , already occupying all of the lower energy states so that , due to the Pauli exclusion principle no other electron could fall into them .
Sometimes , however , one of these negative energy particles could be lifted out of this Dirac sea to become a positive energy particle .
These he interpreted as the proton , and called his paper of 1930 A theory of electrons and protons .
Another difficulty was the difference in masses of the electron and the proton .
Dirac tried to argue that this was due to the electromagnetic interactions with the sea , until Hermann Weyl proved that hole theory was completely symmetric between negative and positive charges .
Robert Oppenheimer and Igor Tamm proved that this would cause ordinary matter to disappear too fast .
A year later , in 1931 , Dirac modified his theory and postulated the positron , a new particle of the same mass as the electron .
The discovery of this particle the next year removed the last two objections to his theory .
Also , as we now know , bosons also have antiparticles , but since they do not obey the Pauli exclusion principle , hole theory doesn't work for them .
A unified interpretation of antiparticles is now available in quantum field theory , which solves both these problems .
Particle-antiparticle annihilation
The single-photon annihilation of an electron-positron pair , + → can not occur because it is impossible to conserve energy and momentum together in this process .
The reverse reaction is also impossible for this reason .
However , in quantum field theory this process is allowed as an intermediate quantum state for times short enough that the violation of energy conservation can be accommodated by the uncertainty principle .
These processes are important in the vacuum state and renormalization of a quantum field theory .
It also opens the way for neutral particle mixing through processes such as the one pictured here : which is a complicated example of mass renormalization .
Properties of antiparticles
If |p , σ,n > denotes the quantum state of a particle -LRB- n -RRB- with momentum p , spin J whose component in the z-direction is σ , then one has
where nc denotes the charge conjugate state , i.e. , the antiparticle .
This behaviour under CPT is the same as the statement that the particle and its antiparticle lie in the same irreducible representation of the Poincare group .
If T is a good symmetry of the dynamics , then
where the proportionality sign indicates that there might be a phase on the right hand side .
In other words , particle and antiparticle must have
the same spin state J
opposite electric charges q and -q .
Quantum field theory
One may try to quantize an electron field without mixing the annihilation and creation operators by writing
where we use the symbol k to denote the quantum numbers p and σ of the previous section and the sign of the energy , E -LRB- k -RRB- , and ak denotes the corresponding annihilation operators .
Of course , since we are dealing with fermions , we have to have the operators satisfy canonical anti-commutation relations .
then one sees immediately that the expectation value of H need not be positive .
This is because E -LRB- k -RRB- can have any sign whatsoever , and the combination of creation and annihilation operators has expectation value 1 or 0 .
So one has to introduce the charge conjugate antiparticle field , with its own creation and annihilation operators satisfying the relations
Then one can rewrite the field in the form
where the first sum is over positive energy states and the second over those of negative energy .
The energy becomes
The vacuum state is defined as the state with no particle or antiparticle , i.e. , and .
Then the energy of the vacuum is exactly E0 .
Since all energies are measured relative to the vacuum , H is positive definite .
This is the case of a fermion .
This approach is due to Vladimir Fock , Wendell Furry and Robert Oppenheimer .
If one quantizes a real scalar field , then one finds that there is only one kind of annihilation operator ; therefore real scalar fields describe neutral bosons .
The Feynman-Stueckelberg interpretation
This technique is the most widespread method of computing amplitudes in quantum field theory today .

Girl reading a Letter at an Open Window is a painting finished in 1657 by the Dutch painter Johannes Vermeer .
In this painting , a young woman stands in the center of the composition , facing in profile an open window to the left .
The picture was acquired in 1724 by August III , elector of Saxony , together with a number of other paintings bought in Paris .
In 1783 , it was engraved as a work by Govaert Flinck .
From 1826 to 1860 , the appellation was altered to Pieter de Hooch .
It is only since 1862 that the correct identification obtains .
Tahiti is the largest island in the Windward group of French Polynesia , located in the archipelago of Society Islands in the southern Pacific Ocean .
Tahiti is estimated to have been settled between AD 300 and 800 by Polynesians , although some estimates place the date earlier .
The fertile soil combined with fishing provided food .
Although the first European sighting of the islands was by a Spanish ship in 1606 , Spain made no effort to trade with or colonise the island .
The relaxed and contented nature of the people and the characterisation of the island as a paradise impressed early Europeans , planting the seed for a romanticisation by the West that endures to this day .
Wallis was followed in April 1768 by the French explorer Louis-Antoine de Bougainville , completing the first French circumnavigation .
Bougainville made Tahiti famous in Europe when he published Voyage autour du monde .
His account illustrated the concept of the noble savage , and influenced utopian thoughts of philosophers such as Jean-Jacques Rousseau before the French Revolution .
After Cook , European ships landed with greater frequency .
The best-known was HMS Bounty , whose crew mutinied after leaving Tahiti in 1789 .
Introduced diseases including typhus , influenza and smallpox killed so many Tahitians that by 1797 , the population was only 16,000 .
Later it was to drop as low as 6,000 .
In 1842 , a European crisis involving Morocco escalated between France and Great Britain when Admiral Dupetit Thouars , acting independently of the French government , convinced Tahiti 's Queen Pomare IV to accept a French protectorate .
However he returned to work towards indoctrinating the locals against the Roman Catholic French .
In November 1843 , Dupetit-Thouars -LRB- again on his own initiative -RRB- landed sailors on the island , annexing it to France .
He then threw Pritchard into prison , subsequently sending him back to Britain .
The French statesman François Guizot , supported by King Louis-Philippe of France , had denounced annexation of the island .
However , war between the French and the Tahitians continued until 1847 .
The island remained a French protectorate until June 29 , 1880 , when King Pomare V -LRB- 1842–1891 -RRB- was forced to cede the sovereignty of Tahiti and its dependencies to France .
In 2003 , French Polynesia 's status was changed to that of Collectivité d'outre-mer -LRB- French overseas community -RRB- .
Tahitians are French citizens with nearly full civil and political rights .
The Tahitian language and the French language are both in use .
The former President of French Polynesia , Oscar Temaru , advocates full independence from France , however , only about 20 % of the population is in favour .
During a press conference on June 26 , 2006 during the second France-Oceania Summit , French President Jacques Chirac said he did not think the majority of Tahitians wanted independence .
He would keep an open door to a possible referendum in the future .
On October 8 , 2004 , Flosse succeeded in passing a censure motion against the Government , provoking a crisis .
A controversy is whether the national government of France should use its power to call for new elections in a local government in case of a political crisis .
French painter Paul Gauguin lived on Tahiti in the 1890s and painted many Tahitian subjects .
Tourism is a significant industry , mostly to the islands of Bora Bora and Moorea .
In July , the Heiva festival in Papeete celebrates Polynesian culture and the commemoration of the storming of the Bastille in France .

The genus Aesculus -LRB- -RRB- , the buckeyes and Horse Chestnuts , comprises 13-19 species of woody trees and shrubs native to the temperate northern hemisphere , with 6 species native to North America and 7-13 species native to Eurasia ; there are also several hybrids .
This genus has traditionally been treated in the ditypic family Hippocastanaceae along with Billia , but recent phylogenetic analysis of morphological and molecular data has led to this family , along with the Aceraceae -LRB- Maples and Dipteronia -RRB- , being included in the soapberry family -LRB- Sapindaceae -RRB- .
Aesculus are woody plants from 4 to 36m tall -LRB- depending on species -RRB- , and have stout shoots with resinous , often sticky , buds ; opposite , palmately divided leaves , often very large -LRB- to 65 cm across in the Japanese Horse Chestnut Aesculus turbinata -RRB- .
Uses
The nuts contain high concentrations of a saponin -class toxin called aesculin , which is toxic to many animals including humans because it causes hemolysis -LRB- destruction of red blood cells -RRB- .
The saponin can be eliminated by leaching the pulverized nuts in multiple changes of boiling water , to yield a wholesome starchy porridge once important to some Native American peoples .
In mathematics , especially order theory , a partially ordered set -LRB- or poset -RRB- formalizes the intuitive concept of an ordering , sequencing , or arrangement of the elements of a set .
Formal definition
A partial order is a binary relation `` ≤ '' over a set P which is reflexive , antisymmetric , and transitive , i.e. , for all a , b , and c in P , we have that :
if a ≤ b and b ≤ a then a = b -LRB- antisymmetry -RRB- ;
if a ≤ b and b ≤ c then a ≤ c -LRB- transitivity -RRB- .
A set with a partial order is called a partially ordered set -LRB- also called a poset -RRB- .
In particular , totally ordered sets can also be referred to as `` ordered sets '' , especially in areas where these structures are more common than posets .
Examples
The Hasse diagram of the set of all subsets of a three-element set -LCB- x , y , z -RCB- , ordered by inclusion .
The set of subsets of a given set -LRB- its power set -RRB- ordered by inclusion -LRB- see the figure on top-right -RRB- .
The set of subspaces of a vector space ordered by inclusion .
Strict and non-strict partial orders
Thus , for all a , b , and c in P , we have that :
¬ -LRB- a < a -RRB- -LRB- irreflexivity -RRB- ;
if a < b then ¬ -LRB- b < a -RRB- -LRB- asymmetry -RRB- ; and
Strict partial orders are useful because they correspond more directly to directed acyclic graphs -LRB- dags -RRB- : every strict partial order is a dag , and the transitive closure of a dag is both a strict partial order and also a dag itself .
Number of partial orders
Sequence -LSB- A001035 -RSB- in OEIS gives the number of partial orders on a set of n elements :
Linear extension
A total order T is a linear extension of a partial order P if , whenever x ≤ y in P it also holds that x ≤ y in T .

Pietro Pomponazzi -LRB- September 16 , 1462 – May 18 , 1525 -RRB- was an Italian philosopher .
Aury was born in Paris , France , in around 1788 .
He served in the French Navy , but from 1802 served in privateer ships .
He was then commissioned as `` Commodore of the Navy of New Grenada '' -LRB- Colombia -RRB- , and at great expense , evacuated hundreds of people from the besieged city of Cartagena , Colombia to Haiti .
He then accepted a commission from the fledgling Republic of Mexico as Civil and Military Governor of Texas , and established a privateering base on Galveston Island , Texas , in September 1816 .
However while Aury was away transporting Francisco Javier Mina and his men to Mexico , Jean Lafitte took control of the base at Galveston .
He was thrown from a horse and killed in August 1821 , though some sources claim he was living in Havana in 1845 .
Aury attempts to liberate Central America
In order attempt to secure their independence , the Colombian insurgents fitted a combined sea and land expedition to operate against the ports of Omoa and Trujillo .
The port 's garrison , commanded by Jose M. Palomar , at once made preparations for emergencies during the impending attack .
The following day Commodore Aury moved the flotilla to the mouth of the Guaimoreto river and began bombardment .
A portion of the land force then attempted to enter the town by the rear , but was detected and driven out .
On the 25th the flotilla appeared off the port of Omoa and for several days attempted to land .
Commodore Aury was unsuccessful and left the area on the 6th of May .
Aury was perceived as a member of the Colombian fighters because of his affiliation with Simon Bolivar .
The constitution repealed restrictions on voting and added universal direct suffrage and the right to work to rights guaranteed by the previous constitution .
In addition , the Constitution recognized collective social and economic rights including the rights to work , rest and leisure , health protection , care in old age and sickness , housing , education , and cultural benefits .
The constitution also provided for the direct election of all government bodies and their reorganization into a single , uniform system .
The 1936 constitution changed the name of the Central Executive Committee to the Supreme Soviet of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics .
Like its predecessor , the Supreme Soviet contained two chambers : the Soviet of the Union and the Soviet of Nationalities .
The constitution empowered the Supreme Soviet to elect commissions , which performed most of the Supreme Soviet 's work .
The Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet became the titular head of state .
The Sovnarkom -LRB- after 1946 known as the Council of Ministers -RRB- continued to act as the executive arm of the government .
Of the four Soviet constitutions , the 1936 constitution survived longest .
The constitution was seen as a personal triumph for Stalin , who on this occasion was described by Pravda as `` genius of the new world , the wisest man of the epoch , the great leader of communism . ''
Western historians and historians from former Soviet occupied countries have seen the constitution as a meaningless propaganda document .
Leonard Schapiro , for example , writes that `` The decision to alter the electoral system from indirect to direct election , from a limited to a universal franchise , and from open to secret voting , was a measure of the confidence of the party in its ability to ensure the return of candidates of its own choice without the restrictions formerly considered necessary , '' and that `` ... a careful scrutiny of the draft of the new constitution showed that it left the party 's supreme position unimpaired , and was therefore worthless as a guarantee of individual rights .

History
Before Terrytoons
Terry first worked for Bray Studios in 1916 , where he created the Farmer Al Falfa series .
Circa 1921 , Terry founded the Fables animation studio , named for its Aesop 's Film Fables series , in conjunction with Amadee J. Van Beuren .
Fables churned out a Fable cartoon every week for eight years in the 1920s .
Terry refused , and Van Beuren fired him in 1929 .
Through much of its history , the studio was considered one of the lowest-quality houses in the field , to the point where Paul Terry noted , `` Disney is the Tiffany 's in this business , and I am the Woolworth 's . ''
Terry 's studio had the lowest budgets and was among the slowest to adapt to new technologies such as sound -LRB- in about 1930 -RRB- and Technicolor -LRB- in 1942 -RRB- , while its graphic style remained remarkably static for decades .
Changing hands
Deitch 's most notable works at the studio were the Tom Terrific cartoon segments for the Captain Kangaroo television show .
He also introduced a number of new characters , such as Sick Sick Sidney , Gaston Le Crayon , John Doormat , and Clint Clobber .
Deitch brought much creativity and life to the Terrytoons cartoons , but because he was the new man at the studio , he wasn't entirely welcome .
After Deitch was fired in 1958 , Bill Weiss took control of the studio .
Under his supervision , Heckle and Jeckle and Mighty Mouse went back into production .
In addition , the studio began producing the Deputy Dawg series for television in 1960 .
Bakshi would later go on to produce Mighty Mouse : The New Adventures for television in 1987 .
Post-history
After the departure of Bakshi after 1966 , the studio petered out and finally closed in 1968 .
Fortunately for the studio , its existing cartoon library saw a long life in TV reruns .
The Terrytoons cartoons -LRB- especially Mighty Mouse and Deputy Dawg -RRB- were syndicated to many local TV markets , and they were a staple of after-school and Saturday morning cartoon shows for over three decades , from the 1950s through the 1980s , until the television rights to the library were acquired by USA Network in 1989 .
In the 1970s , the CBS Films properties were spun off to create Viacom , which itself re-merged with CBS in 1999 .
Later in 1987 , Ralph Bakshi produced Mighty Mouse : The New Adventures which lasted for two seasons .
Bakshi and John Kricfalusi inspired the staff to try to get as much Jim Tyer style drawing in the show .
Tyer , a stand-out Terry animator of the original cartoons with a unique style , became a strong influence on the artists of the Bakshi series .

Gethen 's axis is not tilted -LRB- as is the case with Earth -RRB- , but a relatively high orbital eccentricity produces global seasons .
At the time of the story , Gethen is in the midst of an Ice Age -LRB- some local scientists believe it is near the end -RRB- .
The poles and a large portion of the land around them are permanently covered with glaciers , and even in the inhabited areas the climate can be extremely cold .
A summer day at 30 degrees Celsius is compared -LRB- by a Gethenian -RRB- to being inside a furnace .
Gethenians are physically and culturally adapted to cold ; they tend to be of robust build and short stature , and they are familiar with the caloric yield of many different types of food .
-LRB- The physical adaptations might be a product of genetic manipulation by the Hain , the species that `` seeded '' many worlds in the Ekumen with humanoid lifeforms . -RRB-
Thus each individual can both sire and bear children .
Gethen orbits its primary star once every 0.96 Earth years -LRB- 8401 Earth hours -RRB- .
The planet rotates around its axis in 23.08 earth hours , so a Gethenian year consists of 364 local days .
The year is divided into 14 of these lunar months .
By fortunate coincidence , the deviation between this lunisolar calendar and the true solar year is small enough to require a correction only once every 200 years .
Each day in a month has a unique name .
Historical records employ well-known events to mark -LRB- fixed -RRB- past dates .
Cartography
Gethen has four continents and an archipelago .
The action of the novel takes place here .
The other continents are Sith and the Antarctic continent , Perunter .
The planet is covered with ice everywhere beyond 45 degrees , and often down to 30 degrees .
