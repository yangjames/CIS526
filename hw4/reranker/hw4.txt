the latest training took place late on monday on манхэттенской side of the east river .
" those whom i know several cops , and which drew on this case , said that their direct in zuccotti park , " said the man who spoke on condition of anonymity .
one of the reasons for secrecy was a lesson learned the city .

" correctly to make it when in the park is the fewest people , " he said .
floodlights and pre - recorded announcement , несущиеся blared from loudspeakers устрашили , it seems , many protesters .
police said that tents not touched until 1:45 a.m. , giving the protesters time to collect things .
but many journalists argue that they did n't see how the police , and that police treated them rudely .
when police went to the west through a pile of personal belongings antifiltration protesters , including bags , plastic mats and bags full of clothing , the health department followed the team , it was collecting what брошено .
the main group of protesters took positions near the kitchen camp , central park .
about 10 people in the epicenter of the camps сковали myself together holding hands .

school employees union , representing hundreds of staff , who lost seats in last month , plans to sue the city on wednesday , arguing that layoffs were not needed and were discriminatory because of the disproportionate influence on the school , where poor students .
six hundred and seventy - two school assistant coordinator , working with parents and other employees who were among the most low - wage workers in the city , have lost their place on october 7 , as a result of that union leaders called the political reaction to their refusal to give access to medical city funds , managed workers ' groups , to close a hole in the budget last spring .
at a hearing in the city council last month , schools chancellor dennis m. уолкотт said that layoffs were part of the budget , which they signed in june .
representatives of the district council 37 reported that they have the notice claims , department of education , warning that filed against him ; on wednesday will be held a press conference to announce the formal filing suit in state supreme court in manhattan .
elizabeth thomas , a spokesman for the city 's legal department , said the city is not seen the lawsuit and therefore cannot comment on its specific provisions .
he points out that while the статен - island was not layoffs , but schools in upper east side or трибеки were little , 17 auxiliary workers in браунсвилле 23 schools lost seats in the district , brooklyn , and 46 in the south bronx , was forced to resign in districts 8 and 9 .
p.s. 36th 3,26 per cent was scrapped in budget this year , and it also lost money , when the city has changed the way of counting additional funding for each poor student , who is enrolled in school .

language may seem harmless , but still no discussion on libya was not easy .
kerry and mccain introduced a resolution in june , allows limited use of american forces in libya .
but the same day , when the bill failed in the house of representatives , the chamber also supported a proposal that would not cut funding for u.s. operations in libya .
resolution " admires the people of libya 's foreign affairs committee for his incredible bravery and formidable resistance in the quest for freedom " and thanked the men and women of the united states armed forces and their coalition partners , who participated in military operations to protect the libyan people for their unusual courage and professionalism . "
whether the new measures will receive full support of the council on foreign affairs or расколют legislators as june bill ?
представитель люгера said on monday that he has not yet seen the latest bill .
this measure , proposed a member of the u.s. house of representatives , republican bob гудлатом ( virginia ) , will be the first constitutional amendment on the budget or about anything else that will be on the plenary vote of congress this session .
поправка гудлата - just one of the 68 constitutional amendments , affecting a wide range of issues , which were made in this meeting .
there are at least 15 versions of the balanced budget amendment only in the house and much else about the " control federal spending . "
the budget control act , which passed in august , demanded that the house of representatives , and the senate voted for a balanced budget amendment .
in addition to the budget , some lawmakers want to limit the number of terms of members of congress , and house of representatives member jose serrano ( democrat ) , new york wants to abolish the limit of two terms for president .
amendment banning same - sex marriages already offer many years , and another banning burning the flag .
as were members of congress to offer amendments , they are not faster than in previous years .
this rate pales in comparison with the beginning of the 1990s , when members of congress , according to the library of the senate , regularly offered more than 150 amendments every two years .
the latest amendment , which was adopted , the 27 - i - was approved by parliament in 1992 , but in congress it was actually in 1789 .

" we are not victims , " said brigadier general sean b. mcfarland , who commanded troops in iraq and soon left in afghanistan .
this is a very sensitive topic for commanders , who do not want to seem ungrateful or несогласными with society , which they serve .

some will look at them with admiration , because they smash the rebels and used in exotic locations .
while looking for work , he says , he felt that some interviewers cautiously asked whether he will be able to withstand the strain responsible work immediately after the military campaign in washington .
uneasy that military experience , partly derives from american indifference to the wars .
" we , as a nation , no longer appreciate military heroism , as it was quite usual in world war ii , " says david бэрноу retired lieutenant general who commanded u.s. forces in afghanistan .

nevertheless , the apparent closeness scalia and thomas to two legal firms in this case , as well as to companies with big financial interests , was sufficient signal for activists of ethics in government .
" judges wined and dined on the official campaign fundraising with lawyers , which now covers the court . "
scalia and thomas barely pay attention to critics who say they are quite willing to mix business with the court фигурирующими in groups like federalists .
moreover , conservatives argue that this is about justice elena kagan ethical question arises , rather than scalia and thomas .
her critics , demanded that kagan refused a hearing on this case because she was too involved in the protection of the law , then , to be impartial now .

" asia can be protected to some extent , but it cannot be invulnerable . "
european monetary union was badly undermined by the european debt crisis in recent months .
unfolding in europe 's debt crisis has spawned fears that he could bring the world economy into recession again , and led to calls for the leading emerging economies come together to help the eurozone find a solution .
anand sharma , india 's trade minister , said that " india will do everything that can " to help the eurozone , as its own economy is now declining exports and foreign capital inflows .
" we have ambitious goals , and we must maintain a high level of growth . "
others argue that there is no sense for emerging economies like india to help wealthy europeans , when they face their own deep economic problems .

defense secretary leon panetta tempers in congress on monday , warning that expected automatic budget cuts will undermine national security and bring the financial chain reaction from pentagon corridors to the fields of battle in afghanistan on the line and civic assembly .
" the impact these cuts would be devastating for the state department , " panetta said in a letter to senators республиканке республиканцу john mccain , arizona and lindsey graham of south carolina .
" so , make such a strong reduction , the majority of our construction projects кораблестроению and unfulfilled -- you ca n't buy a three - quarters of the ship or buildings -- and would seriously damage other modernization efforts , " panetta wrote senators .
" these changes undermine trust , who supports our army and will seriously damage боеготовности . "
" while not directly affected military funding overseas contingency operations секвестром , military to be severely affected by serious breakdown in the main budgets , " warned panetta .
" staff will be reduced that lead to опозданиям staffer with military suppliers , and legal and political support will be disrupted . "
" the consequences of sequestration in the department of defense will be a rapid decline in the united states as the world 's leading military power . "
" this is not an option , with which we live in , and this is not an option that we need to impose ourselves . "
whether panetta letter or recent warnings senators will lead to budget compromise or inflame calls for release from the pentagon cuts , we 'll see later .
at a press conference last week , defense minister painted a gloomy picture of what may be more troops -- with shell , but without the kernel .
" this paper tiger , the army to barracks , buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers able to accomplish the mission , " panetta said in his introductory remarks in the pentagon .
and panetta said that some of the biggest defence projects may encounter obstacles , including those which passed the tests , and some only in the early stages of planning .
halt to further develop and test f 35 can save $ 80 billion over 10 years , but his supporters say is a vital next step to improve and to counter potential threats , china and other opponents .
a cursory glance at recent headlines , shows how serious and повсеместны deception and lies in everyday life .
administration at the university of pennsylvania was charged лжесвидетельствовании schlensker , because they allegedly hid that retired football coach raped young boys .
former presidential candidate john edwards was indicted in financial fraud during the campaign , involving укрывательством extramarital affairs .
stories of fraud on exams in school and college is the norm .
mentors who should teach the opposite , send a message that the lies and fraud are acceptable .
in one day , studies show that you can lie from 10 to 200 times .
another study showed that strangers солгали three times for the first 10 minutes with each other .
in contrast to the games room , like , say , charades , where you exclaim , " caught ! " to detect lies is a serious direction knowledge , based on scientific data , collected over the past six decades at prestigious universities , comprehensive research projects , especially on psychology and physiology .
not worth of hard to notice and it is difficult to draw the conclusion that liars .
i spent a few years , examining the scientific discoveries of the vast and ever - growing segment of knowledge about lie detection , and it is clear that modern skill , which is easy to learn and that helps in meaningful in our complex world -- especially if your professional duties include recruiting , interviewing , negotiating or management .
we know from research that extroverts lied more frequently than introverts , that men lie about yourself , whereas women -- more about the other , usually to protect someone 's feelings , lied to its partners that married people less than unmarried ( but the lie that they say , often наглая ) .
watch позой , laughter , voice your subject characteristics .
rats can fix the upper part of his body when trying to remember their history , they can put their feet towards the door , bend towards the exit , or change its position in a certain way to demonstrate " relief after the interview " -- this exaggerated sigh of relief and a change in posture , when all the complicated issues behind us .
привирающие people can also use disengagement in the speech : " i have n't had sexual relations with that woman miss lewinsky " or repeat a complicated question entirely . ...
someone can use the " qualification " language , when answering a question : " well ... the truth ... as far as i know ... as far as i know . "
there is no magical means to detect lies , but to master the skill can detect deception .

рафаель эррера chemical faculty unam , researcher , developed a polymer - bitumen , modified to produce a mixture of the best quality , sustainable to the impacts of environmental and temperature .
in his lecture in technological view of the pits , under the international year of chemistry , reported that laboratory , for which he is responsible for developing polymer - modified bitumen mixed with characteristics close to the bitumen production , but with the best opposition , both in high and low temperatures .
he explained that the bitumen , the toughest part of the oil is a sequence of hydrocarbon molecules , some high - molecular weight , called асфальтенами and other low - molecular weight called мальтенами , which together give the road to cover his tmina вязкоупругое behaviour .
this means that the resistance street asphalt is not constant , but change throughout the day , depending on the natural conditions and temperatures , specializing in chemical engineering said .
among the upper layers of bitumen that is made up of little stones опущенных bitumen , and then спрессованных .
when vehicles and прикладывании efforts , it helps forces of very well be on the road to cover .
on асфальтовом cover , he added , is the last layer , called a wear layer , which made of small stone , sand also immersed in the asphalt .
as part of the pavement , which will receive and distribute data layer wear also requires the proper thickness , and efforts should take into consideration the material , from which he is .
when the earth crude , water into coverage and it is hard to leave , it causes размягчение all cover , and therefore education yam .

the magazine , journalist _guido ойос кромос believes that the mistake the valle de cauca - was that she has undergone surgery .
her body was never her advantage , and here she was punished for it .
so it or not , the fact that we have today мелины begins year rule , not as queen , but as the princess , position , which allows her to represent colombia directly on one of the international competition , the organizers of the national contest .

the average , which hides some abnormalities ; another study , published in 2007 , the site about career management , monster.com , showed that 75 % of the 40,000 french workers surveyed said they did n't take a single day of the hospital .

fraud associated with hospital sheets , very low level compared with the " grey " employment .
stricter law since 2002 led to systematic проверке hospital lasting more than 45 days .

germany , in turn , documented the growth of 0.5 % for the same period .
if there is a theme , the decision which cannot be taken after a short discussion or under the influence of emotions , so it 's an energy policy .
this is a healthy trend that electoral meeting place , and become an occasion for reflection on the share of their nuclear energy .
france must build their opinion on objective facts and data on the rational .
during the same period will be necessary to complete fossil resources to continue electricity production is growing deficit , not forgetting the critical need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to fight climate imbalances - theme , which disappeared from the environmental debate .
that is why germany is one in his decision to abandon nuclear energy .
on the other hand , britain , finland , poland , czech republic , netherlands , sweden , south africa , china , india , brazil is just a few of those who resolutely keeps his projects .
although the german model , based on renewable energy , sometimes cited as an example , the reality belies this argument .
european champion construction of turbines , from which she receives 30 percent of its electricity , as well as the biggest consumer of coal and gas прерывистого due ; the wind , carbon dioxide emissions and electricity prices by 65 per cent , respectively , and 50 % higher than average in europe .
as the price of energy is a key factor in a globalized economy competitiveness and service of industrial equipment in the national territory , the french company benefiting from cheap electricity in europe .
the price that most french refuse to pay more because they do not oppose in principle , this type of energy .
heavily export - oriented , it attracts a плеяду specialized on international trade in small and medium enterprises and create many jobs that cannot be moved into another industry .
what engineer and electrician would order the epr , calculated to sixty years , if the planned closure of its manufacturer ?
areva solutions with low carbon development , nuclear and renewable energy sources , shows взаимодополнимости .
in france we have security agency , which monitors existing edged and transparent energy centres , such as фламанвиль .
for 50 years , the nuclear industry has survived three serious incident .
in the chernobyl reactor and unforgivable human error led to tragedy .
nuclear industry извлечет lessons from this accident as the learned from the previous two .
as it is all specialists in the field of energy to build a reactor , will halt its construction in фламанвиле magnificent gift competitors areva and edf , menacing them ​​путь to conquer leadership in the imminent development of nuclear energy .
then were administrative harassment of foreign students , which in the news , when the minister of interior ( " либерасьон from 23 may ) , said that france " do n't need foreign talent , bricklayers and waiters . "
both sides see the burden for the french economy and immigration for french society .
in his program francois hollande ограничился platitudes , saying that " joint work will solve our immigration problem . "
as ian goldin and remind us economists jeffrey cameron in a recent book обобщившей recent data on immigration ( special : how migration shaped our world and people determine our future , may 2011 , at princeton university , with 352 . ) , a broad consensus among experts about the positive impact of migration flows , wages and employment growth in countries that accept immigrants .
influenced by fears of immigrants based on the view that they can replace the local workers , especially low - skilled , provoking wage declines .
unskilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract local labor , and most skilled , dynamic sectors , where training is not linked to offers of work .
just as the surgeon would be hard to work in the country , where there is a shortage of анестезиологов , complementarity between local that the arrival of immigrants and immigrants , leads to positively affect wages local workers .
and without taking into account the fact that this diversity , вносимое immigrants , to create new ideas and economic growth ( among american nobel laureates high proportion of naturalised immigrants , and google , intel , paypal and yahoo were all founded immigrants ) .
labor organization estimates that in germany , for example , the immigrant , arrived at the age of 30 years , life will bring state budget net profit ( revenue minus expenses ) in an average of 150,000 euros .
these teeth , which used to scare immigrants , gave exactly the opposite effect .
democracy is a valuable acquisition ; but also fragile .
some thought that democracy has triumphed over their enemies , enough to vote and make it as direct as possible .
universal vote , though it is essential to democracy , it is not sufficient condition and may even become a tool of suppression " , as republican once philosopher etienne вашро said .
the european crisis that we are , is the economic crisis , but first , this political crisis and democracy .
we do n't win anything , demanding series of national referendums , organized as needed and хаотическом order .
no , we are dreaming not лезвии guillotine , but on the implementation of the joint , clear and constant - choice and democracy , this time on level .
the entire europe submits to the dictates of markets and rating agencies , suffers from its weakness and lack of solidarity .
many worry about transfer europe , but the whole europe gradually loses its sovereignty , and with each of her nations .
because only europeans working together can reduce the severity of debt each , free markets and prepare for the future , by investing in it .
after a lengthy discussion of this proposal now require all socialists and jacques delors european economic government .
but to submit it without a stronger economic , political and democratic integration , вошедшей граздан in life , is another madness and a new impasse .
to establish the republic , france needed to " create " republicans .
this can only be done by creating a more democratic europe on the political level , this popular european sovereignty .
