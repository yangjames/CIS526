" asia can be protected to some extent , but it may not be immune . "
the european monetary union was undermined by the european debt crisis in recent months .
unfolding in europe 's debt crisis has spawned fears that he could bring the world economy into recession again , and led to calls for the leading emerging economies come together to help the eurozone find a solution .
anand sharma , india 's trade minister , said that " india will do everything that can , " to help the eurozone , such as its own economy is now declining exports and decline in foreign capital inflows .
" we have ambitious goals , and we must maintain a high level of growth . "
others argue that there is no sense for emerging economies like india to help wealthy europeans , when they are faced with their own deep economic problems .

defense secretary leon panetta tempers in congress on monday , warning that the automatic budget cuts will undermine national security and the financial chain reaction of the pentagon corridors to the fields of battle in afghanistan on the line and civil assembly .
" the impact these cuts would be devastating for the state department , " panetta said in a letter to senators республиканке республиканцу john mccain , arizona and lindsey graham of south carolina .
" so , will make such a strong decline , the majority of our construction projects on кораблестроению and unfulfilled -- you ca n't buy a three - quarters of the ship or buildings -- and do serious damage other modernization efforts , " panetta wrote senators .
" these changes will undermine the credibility of those who support our army and will seriously damage combat readiness . "
" while foreign military financing in the emergency operations does not directly affected секвестром , the military to be severely affected by serious breakdown in the main budgets , " panetta warned .
" staff would be reduced , which will lead to опозданиям staff with military suppliers , and the legal and political support will be disturbed . "
" the consequences of sequestration in the department of defense will be a rapid decline in the united states as the world 's leading military power . "
" this is not an option , with which we live in , and this is not an option that we need to impose ourselves . "
whether panetta letter or recent warnings from senators will lead to the pentagon 's budget compromise or strengthen calls for release from cutbacks , will see later .
at a press conference last week , secretary of defense painted a gloomy picture of what may be more troops -- with shell , but without the core .
" it 's a paper tiger , the army to barracks , buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers able to accomplish the mission , " panetta said in his introductory remarks in the pentagon .
and panetta said that some of the biggest defense project may encounter obstacles , including those that passed the tests , and some only on the early stages of planning .
to further develop and test f 35 can save $ 80 billion over 10 years , but his supporters say that this is a vital next step to improve and to counter potential threats , china and other opponents .
a cursory glance at recent headlines , shows just how serious and повсеместны deception and lies in everyday life .
administration at the university of pennsylvania was charged in лжесвидетельствовании schlensker , because they allegedly attempted to hide that a retired football coach raping boys .
former presidential candidate john edwards was charged in the financial machinations during the campaign , involving укрывательством extramarital affairs .
stories of fraud on the tests in school and college is the norm .
mentors who should teach the opposite , send a message that the lies and fraud are acceptable .
in a single day , studies show that you can lie from 10 to 200 times .
another study showed that strangers солгали three times for the first 10 minutes to get acquainted with each other .
in contrast to the room of the game , like , say , charades , where you exclaim , " caught ! " detection of lies is a serious direction knowledge , based on scientific data , collected over the past six decades at prestigious universities , comprehensive research projects , particularly in psychology and physiology .
not from this hard to notice and it is difficult to draw the conclusion that liars .
i spent several years , examining the scientific discoveries of the vast and ever - growing segment of knowledge about lie detection , and it is clear that the modern skill , which is easy to learn and that helps in our complex in the world -- especially if your professional duties include recruiting , interviewing , negotiating or management .
we know from research that extroverts lied more frequently than introverts , that men lie about yourself , whereas women -- more about the other , usually in order to protect someone 's feelings , that married people lied to its partners , less than unmarried ( but the lie that they say , often наглая ) .
watch позой , laughter , voice your subject characteristics .
rats can fix the upper part of his body , when they try to remember their history , they can put their feet towards the door , bend towards the exit , to change its position in a certain way , or " relief after the interview " -- this exaggerated sigh of relief and a change in posture , when all the complex issues behind us .
привирающие people can also use the disengagement in the speech : " i 've never had sexual relations with that woman miss lewinsky ... " or repeat the question entirely .
someone can use the " qualification " language , when answering a question : " well ... the truth ... as far as i know ... as far as i know . "
there is no magical means to detect lies , but to master the skill of deception detection .

emma марчегалия , leader of the italian employers ' federation , told reporters after meeting with monti : " we were told that we will actively support this government . "
monti 's chances of success were largely based on the ldp 's support of the party of silvio berlusconi , who was forced to resign on saturday because of the economic crisis .

рафаель эррера , a researcher at the department of chemical , unam , has developed a polymer - bitumen modified to produce a mixture of the best quality , sustainable to the impact of environmental and temperature .
in his lecture in technological view of the pits , as part of the international year of chemistry , reported that laboratory , for which he is responsible for developing polymer - modified bitumen mixed with characteristics close to the bitumen production , but with the best opposition , both high and at low temperatures .
he explained that the bitumen , the most difficult part of the oil is a sequence of hydrocarbon molecules , some high - molecular weight , called асфальтенами and other low - molecular weight called мальтенами , which together give the road to cover his характерное вязкоупругое behaviour .
this means that the resistance street asphalt is not constant , and changes in the day , depending on the natural conditions and temperature , said an expert in chemical engineering .
among the top of the layers of bitumen is made of small stones , опущенных спрессованных bitumen and then .
when vehicles and прикладывании efforts , it helps forces of very well be on the road to cover .
the асфальтовом surface , he added , is the last layer , called a layer of wear and tear , which is made of small stone , sand and immersed in the asphalt .
as part of the pavement , which will receive and distribute these efforts , wear also requires the proper thickness , and must be taken into account material from which he is .

in his program francois hollande ограничился platitudes , saying that " joint work will solve our immigration problem . "
as ian goldin and remind us economists jeffrey cameron in a recent book , обобщившей past data on immigration ( special : how migration shaped our world and people will determine our future , may 2011 , at princeton university , with 352 . ) , a broad consensus among experts about the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth , employment and wages in countries that accept immigrants .
influenced by fears of immigrants based on the view that they can replace the local workers , especially low - skilled , provoking wage declines .
unskilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract local labor , and the most skilled in the dynamic sectors , where training is not linked to the proposals .
just as the surgeon would be hard to work in a country where there is a shortage анестезиологов , complementarity , between local that the arrival of immigrants and immigrants , leads to positively affect the salaries of local workers .
and this without taking into account the fact that diversity , вносимое immigrants , to create new ideas and economic growth ( among american nobel laureates large share of naturalised immigrants , and google , intel , paypal and yahoo were all immigrants are based ) .
according to the labor organization , for example , in germany , an immigrant , arrived at the age of 30 years , for his life will bring to the state budget net profit ( revenue minus expenses ) , an average of 150,000 euros .

democracy is fragile and valuable acquisition ; but at the same time .

because only collaborative effort of the europeans will be able to reduce the severity of debt each , free markets and prepare for the future , investing in it .
after a lengthy discussion of this proposal now require all socialists and jacques delors european economic government .
but to submit it without a stronger economic , political and democratic integration , вошедшей граздан in life , is another madness and a new impasse .
to establish a republic in france , had to " create a " republican .
this can only be done by creating a more democratic europe at the political level , this popular european sovereignty .
